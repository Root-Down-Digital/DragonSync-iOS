## Features

- **Real-Time Airspace Monitoring**  
  Track the status and location of Remote ID-compliant UAVs on your iOS device. See flightpaths and comprehensive decoded data of any RID broadcast.

- **Spoof Detection**
  Uses advanced algorithms to identify anomalies in flight data, providing a confidence score and detailed insights when spoofing is detected.

- **Instant System Alerts**  
  Stay informed with real-time status updates about your systemâ€™s performance & location. Memory, GPS, CPU, temp and more. WarDragon Pro also displays ANTSDR internal temperatures.

- **Detect the Undetectable:**

  *SDR-Powered Drone Detection & Decoding with WarDragon Pro. Support for Ocusync and other difficult signals*

  OcuSync's advanced frequency-hopping and encrypted communication make it nearly invisible to standard detection tools.

- **Seamless WarDragon Integration**  
  Designed to work flawlessly with the WarDragon DragonOS platform directly over ZMQ or broader applications with Multicast. A unified and user-friendly experience out of the box. 

- **Flexible Protocol Support**  
  Supports ZMQ and Multicast configurations to receive CoT and status messages, tailored to your operational needs.

## Requirements

**Option 1. [WarDragon/Pro](https://cemaxecuter.com/?post_type=product)**

**Option 2. DIY**

*Hardware*
- ESP32
- Sniffle compatible BT dongle
- ANTSDR E200
- GPS unit

*Software*
- [DroneID](https://github.com/alphafox02/DroneID)
- [DragonSync Python](https://github.com/alphafox02/DragonSync)
- [DJI Firmware - E200](https://github.com/alphafox02/antsdr_dji_droneid)
- [DJI Firmware - ESP32](https://github.com/alphafox02/T-Halow/tree/wifi_rid/examples/DragonOS_RID_Scanner)


## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to be using the latest versions of @alphafox02 DroneID and DragonSync repos listed above.
>
>To update, navigate to the folders in the `WarDragon` directory in the home directory of the dragon (or in your location) using the command line. Run `git pull` inside both. 

### Connection
The app supports two connection formats:

> **ZMQ Server (JSON)**
> - Includes all data available. Easy setup with direct ZMQ connection and minimal configuration. ***Recommended***

> **Multicast (CoT)**
> - Limited data compared to ZMQ. Needs additional script running and network setup for multicast. Supports multiple sources at once on same network. 

**Using WarDragon Direct ZMQ**
- Ensure that your device is connected to the same network as your WarDragon or host system.
- Launch the app & choose ZMQ from settings 
- Tap the address and enter the IP of the WarDragon (use `arp -a` for example)
- Start the listener & status and drone detection will happen automatically. 

**Multicast**
- Start dragonsync.py and wardragon-monitor.py from the DragonSync repo.
- From the DroneId repo start zmq_decoder.py and WiFi/BT sniffer. 

(Default multicast address is pre-configured for `dragonsync.py`, adjust per network requirements.)

  _**Refer to [dragonsync.py](https://github.com/alphafox02/DragonSync) for detailed instructions & commands**_

  
### Detection

Once activated, detected drones appear in the Drones and History tabs. 

**Drones View**
- Tap the map to view a live feed of drone flight paths from the current session. Select the text to open the detail view, which displays collected data, including takeoff and operator locations when available.

**Encounter History**
- Swipe left on each row to delete it. To export a CSV file or delete the history, use the icon in the top right corner.
- Select a row to visualize the flight data. To export a KML file or change the map style, use the icon in the top right corner. 

### Settings

Warning dials set the value at which dashboard elements change or appear. These differ from the static defaults in the status view.

- Temps and usage will show red when settings are exceeded
- Drones nearby warning is based on the proximity warning value.
