_**TestFlight signups open soon**_

DragonSync is designed to enhance the functionality of the WarDragon system by integrating with [DragonSync](https://github.com/alphafox02/DragonSync) and [DroneID](https://github.com/bkerler/DroneID). None of this would be possible without that work. A big thanks to the devs at [Sniffle](https://github.com/nccgroup/Sniffle). And of course to [@alphafox02](https://github.com/alphafox02) for creating the WarDragon, DragonOS, the above scripts- and showing me how to make this work.

## Features

This application facilitates seamless communication between your iOS device and the WarDragon platform, enabling real-time monitoring of Remote ID-compliant drones with alerts and mapping. It also displays the connected system status updates as sent by `wardragon_monitor.py` & `dragonsync.py`.

- **Real-Time Drone Monitoring**: Receive live updates on drone status and location directly on your iOS device.
- **System Status Alerts**: Stay informed about the health and performance of your WarDragon system.
- **Seamless Integration**: Built to work effortlessly with DragonSync and the WarDragon platform.
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Integrates directly with DroneID and DragonSync using ZMQ and Multicast config options. This allows users to listen for CoT and status messages using Multicast alone or with ZMQ (depending on user needs).

## Functionality

### Display decoded DroneIDs
  - Use ESP32 & other hardware, without no need for ATAK or complex TAK servers.
