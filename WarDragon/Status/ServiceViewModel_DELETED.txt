ServiceViewModel.swift has been removed as it was not being used and was causing errors.

The ServiceViewModel was intercepting status messages meant for StatusViewModel
and trying to parse them as service management JSON, which failed because
the messages are system status in XML format.

If you need service management functionality in the future, it should be
re-implemented with:
1. A separate ZMQ port for service status
2. Proper message routing
3. Integration with StatusViewModel rather than competing with it
